## Welcome to Foundation Model for Breast Cancer MRI (FM-BCMRI).

FM-BCMRI is a vertical foundation model for quantitative MRI analysis in breast cancer. FM-BCMRI is trained on a diverse dataset covering various breast cancer types and stages, and it undergoes meticulous data preprocessing, ensuring optimal input quality. Harnessing advanced deep learning techniques (contrastive learning algorithms), the model extracts deep learning-based features from MRI scans, unveiling crucial insights into contrast enhancement patterns, shape characteristics, and texture features. Positioned for versatile applications in both research and clinical realms, it empowers researchers with nuanced data exploration and provides healthcare professionals with support for informed decision-making.

The FM-BCMRI is designed and developed by Dr.Zhenwei Shi, Zhihe Zhao, Zhitao Wei, Dr.Chu Han and other AI/CS scientists from [Media Lab](https://github.com/GDPHMediaLab). Also, the work is supported and guided by experienced radiologists Prof. MD Zaiyi Liu and Prof. MD Changhong Liang from the radiolgoy department of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.

The FM-BCMRI model was pre-trained by using constrative learning algorithms (Figure A). The FM-BCMRI can be implemented to specific use cases by extracting quantitative imaging features or by task-specitic fine-tuning (Figure B). 
## Installation

Before using the FM-BCMRI foundation model, we need to install related dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If the installation runs slowly, you can try the following method

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

## Quick Start (10 mins)

The FM-BCMRI model can be used in two manners (Figure B). For easy use, we provide an example notebook to describe how it works. The example codes are in Jupyter [notebooks](https).
